ðŸš— About Metrocar

Metrocar's business model is based on a platform that connects riders with drivers through a mobile application. Metrocar acts as an intermediary between riders and drivers, providing a user-friendly platform to connect them and facilitate the ride-hailing process.

ðŸ“¶ Metrocarâ€™s Funnel

The customer funnel for Metrocar typically includes the following stages:

App Download: A user downloads the Metrocar app from the App Store or Google Play Store.

Signup: The user creates an account in the Metrocar app, including their name, email, phone number, and payment information.

Request Ride: The user opens the app and requests a ride by entering their pickup location, destination, and ride capacity (2 to 6 riders).

Driver Acceptance: A nearby driver receives the ride request and accepts the ride.

Ride: The driver arrives at the pickup location, and the user gets in the car and rides to their destination.

Payment: After the ride, the user is charged automatically through the app, and a receipt is sent to their email.

Review: The user is prompted to rate their driver and leave a review of their ride experience.

Similar to other customer funnels, there will be drop-offs at every stage of the funnel, which is why funnel analysis can be helpful in identifying areas for improvement and optimization. For example, Metrocar may analyze the percentage of users who download the app but do not complete the registration process, or the percentage of users who request a ride but cancel before the driver arrives.
